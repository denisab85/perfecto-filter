Perfecto Filter is a Chrome extension for the users of perfectomobile.com continuous integration tool.
While Perfecto itself serves the goal of monitoring the results of test executions, it does not provide any tool to filter the results displayed on the CI dashboard.
This filter extension allows to filter those results by job name.
